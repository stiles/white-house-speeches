       "      <td>The White House THE PRESIDENT: My fellow Americans: Four years ago, we launched a great national effort to rebuild our country, to renew its spirit, and to restore the allegiance of this government to its citizens. In short, we embarked on a mission to make America great again — for all Americans. As I conclude my term as the 45th President of the United States, I stand before you truly proud of what we have achieved together. We did what we came here to do — and so much more. This week, we inaugurate a new administration and pray for its success in keeping America safe and prosperous. We extend our best wishes, and we also want them to have luck — a very important word. I’d like to begin by thanking just a few of the amazing people who made our remarkable journey possible. First, let me express my overwhelming gratitude for the love and support of our spectacular First Lady, Melania. Let me also share my deepest appreciation to my daughter Ivanka, my son-in-law Jared, and to Barron, Don, Eric, Tiffany, and Lara. You fill my world with light and with joy. I also want to thank Vice President Mike Pence, his wonderful wife Karen, and the entire Pence family. Thank you as well to my Chief of Staff, Mark Meadows; the dedicated members of the White House Staff and the Cabinet; and all the incredible people across our administration who poured out their heart and soul to fight for America. I also want to take a moment to thank a truly exceptional group of people: the United States Secret Service. My family and I will forever be in your debt. My profound gratitude as well to everyone in the White House Military Office, the teams of Marine One and Air Force One, every member of the Armed Forces, and state and local law enforcement all across our country. Most of all, I want to thank the American people. To serve as your President has been an honor beyond description. Thank you for this extraordinary privilege. And that’s what it is — a great privilege and a great honor. We must never forget that while Americans will always have our disagreements, we are a nation of incredible, decent, faithful, and peace-loving citizens who all want our country to thrive and flourish and be very, very successful and good. We are a truly magnificent nation. All Americans were horrified by the assault on our Capitol. Political violence is an attack on everything we cherish as Americans. It can never be tolerated. Now more than ever, we must unify around our shared values and rise above the partisan rancor, and forge our common destiny. Four years ago, I came to Washington as the only true outsider ever to win the presidency. I had not spent my career as a politician, but as a builder looking at open skylines and imagining infinite possibilities. I ran for President because I knew there were towering new summits for America just waiting to be scaled. I knew the potential for our nation was boundless as long as we put America first. So I left behind my former life and stepped into a very difficult arena, but an arena nevertheless, with all sorts of potential if properly done. America had given me so much, and I wanted to give something back. Together with millions of hardworking patriots across this land, we built the greatest political movement in the history of our country. We also built the greatest economy in the history of the world. It was about “America First” because we all wanted to make America great again. We restored the principle that a nation exists to serve its citizens. Our agenda was not about right or left, it wasn’t about Republican or Democrat, but about the good of a nation, and that means the whole nation. With the support and prayers of the American people, we achieved more than anyone thought possible. Nobody thought we could even come close. We passed the largest package of tax cuts and reforms in American history. We slashed more job-killing regulations than any administration had ever done before. We fixed our broken trade deals, withdrew from the horrible Trans-Pacific Partnership and the impossible Paris Climate Accord, renegotiated the one-sided South Korea deal, and we replaced NAFTA with the groundbreaking USMCA — that’s Mexico and Canada — a deal that’s worked out very, very well. Also, and very importantly, we imposed historic and monumental tariffs on China; made a great new deal with China. But before the ink was even dry, we and the whole world got hit with the China virus. Our trade relationship was rapidly changing, billions and billions of dollars were pouring into the U.S., but the virus forced us to go in a different direction. The whole world suffered, but America outperformed other countries economically because of our incredible economy and the economy that we built. Without the foundations and footings, it wouldn’t have worked out this way. We wouldn’t have some of the best numbers we’ve ever had. We also unlocked our energy resources and became the world’s number-one producer of oil and natural gas by far. Powered by these policies, we built the greatest economy in the history of the world. We reignited America’s job creation and achieved record-low unemployment for African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, women — almost everyone. Incomes soared, wages boomed, the American Dream was restored, and millions were lifted from poverty in just a few short years. It was a miracle. The stock market set one record after another, with 148 stock market highs during this short period of time, and boosted the retirements and pensions of hardworking citizens all across our nation. 401(k)s are at a level they’ve never been at before. We’ve never seen numbers like we’ve seen, and that’s before the pandemic and after the pandemic. We rebuilt the American manufacturing base, opened up thousands of new factories, and brought back the beautiful phrase: “Made in the USA.” To make life better for working families, we doubled the child tax credit and signed the largest-ever expansion of funding for childcare and development. We joined with the private sector to secure commitments to train more than 16 million American workers for the jobs of tomorrow. When our nation was hit with the terrible pandemic, we produced not one, but two vaccines with record-breaking speed, and more will quickly follow. They said it couldn’t be done but we did it. They call it a “medical miracle,” and that’s what they’re calling it right now: a “medical miracle.” Another administration would have taken 3, 4, 5, maybe even up to 10 years to develop a vaccine. We did in nine months. We grieve for every life lost, and we pledge in their memory to wipe out this horrible pandemic once and for all. When the virus took its brutal toll on the world’s economy, we launched the fastest economic recovery our country has ever seen. We passed nearly $4 trillion in economic relief, saved or supported over 50 million jobs, and slashed the unemployment rate in half. These are numbers that our country has never seen before. We created choice and transparency in healthcare, stood up to big pharma in so many ways, but especially in our effort to get favored-nations clauses added, which will give us the lowest prescription drug prices anywhere in the world. We passed VA Choice, VA Accountability, Right to Try, and landmark criminal justice reform. We confirmed three new justices of the United States Supreme Court. We appointed nearly 300 federal judges to interpret our Constitution as written. For years, the American people pleaded with Washington to finally secure the nation’s borders. I am pleased to say we answered that plea and achieved the most secure border in U.S. history. We have given our brave border agents and heroic ICE officers the tools they need to do their jobs better than they have ever done before, and to enforce our laws and keep America safe. We proudly leave the next administration with the strongest and most robust border security measures ever put into place. This includes historic agreements with Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador, along with more than 450 miles of powerful new wall. We restored American strength at home and American leadership abroad. The world respects us again. Please don’t lose that respect. We reclaimed our sovereignty by standing up for America at the United Nations and withdrawing from the one-sided global deals that never served our interests. And NATO countries are now paying hundreds of billions of dollars more than when I arrived just a few years ago. It was very unfair. We were paying the cost for the world. Now the world is helping us. And perhaps most importantly of all, with nearly $3 trillion, we fully rebuilt the American military — all made in the USA. We launched the first new branch of the United States Armed Forces in 75 years: the Space Force. And last spring, I stood at Kennedy Space Center in Florida and watched as American astronauts returned to space on American rockets for the first time in many, many years. We revitalized our alliances and rallied the nations of the world to stand up to China like never before. We obliterated the ISIS caliphate and ended the wretched life of its founder and leader, al Baghdadi. We stood up to the oppressive Iranian regime and killed the world’s top terrorist, Iranian butcher Qasem Soleimani. We recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. As a result of our bold diplomacy and principled realism, we achieved a series of historic peace deals in the Middle East. Nobody believed it could happen. The Abraham Accords opened the doors to a future of peace and harmony, not violence and bloodshed. It is the dawn of a new Middle East, and we are bringing our soldiers home. I am especially proud to be the first President in decades who has started no new wars. Above all, we have reasserted the sacred idea that, in America, the government answers to the people. Our guiding light, our North Star, our unwavering conviction has been that we are here to serve the noble everyday citizens of America. Our allegiance is not to the special interests, corporations, or global entities; it’s to our children, our citizens, and to our nation itself. As President, my top priority, my constant concern, has always been the best interests of American workers and American families. I did not seek the easiest course; by far, it was actually the most difficult. I did not seek the path that would get the least criticism. I took on the tough battles, the hardest fights, the most difficult choices because that’s what you elected me to do. Your needs were my first and last unyielding focus. This, I hope, will be our greatest legacy: Together, we put the American people back in charge of our country. We restored self-government. We restored the idea that in America no one is forgotten, because everyone matters and everyone has a voice. We fought for the principle that every citizen is entitled to equal dignity, equal treatment, and equal rights because we are all made equal by God. Everyone is entitled to be treated with respect, to have their voice heard, and to have their government listen. You are loyal to your country, and my administration was always loyal to you. We worked to build a country in which every citizen could find a great job and support their wonderful families. We fought for the communities where every American could be safe and schools where every child could learn. We promoted a culture where our laws would be upheld, our heroes honored, our history preserved, and law-abiding citizens are never taken for granted. Americans should take tremendous satisfaction in all that we have achieved together. It’s incredible. Now, as I leave the White House, I have been reflecting on the dangers that threaten the priceless inheritance we all share. As the world’s most powerful nation, America faces constant threats and challenges from abroad. But the greatest danger we face is a loss of confidence in ourselves, a loss of confidence in our national greatness. A nation is only as strong as its spirit. We are only as dynamic as our pride. We are only as vibrant as the faith that beats in the hearts of our people. No nation can long thrive that loses faith in its own values, history, and heroes, for these are the very sources of our unity and our vitality. What has always allowed America to prevail and triumph over the great challenges of the past has been an unyielding and unashamed conviction in the nobility of our country and its unique purpose in history. We must never lose this conviction. We must never forsake our belief in America. The key to national greatness lies in sustaining and instilling our shared national identity. That means focusing on what we have in common: the heritage that we all share. At the center of this heritage is also a robust belief in free expression, free speech, and open debate. Only if we forget who we are, and how we got here, could we ever allow political censorship and blacklisting to take place in America. It’s not even thinkable. Shutting down free and open debate violates our core values and most enduring traditions.\\nIn America, we don’t insist on absolute conformity or enforce rigid orthodoxies and punitive speech codes. We just don’t do that. America is not a timid nation of tame souls who need to be sheltered and protected from those with whom we disagree. That’s not who we are. It will never be who we are. For nearly 250 years, in the face of every challenge, Americans have always summoned our unmatched courage, confidence, and fierce independence. These are the miraculous traits that once led millions of everyday citizens to set out across a wild continent and carve out a new life in the great West. It was the same profound love of our God-given freedom that willed our soldiers into battle and our astronauts into space. As I think back on the past four years, one image rises in my mind above all others. Whenever I traveled all along the motorcade route, there were thousands and thousands of people. They came out with their families so that they could stand as we passed, and proudly wave our great American flag. It never failed to deeply move me. I knew that they did not just come out to show their support of me; they came out to show me their support and love for our country. This is a republic of proud citizens who are united by our common conviction that America is the greatest nation in all of history. We are, and must always be, a land of hope, of light, and of glory to all the world. This is the precious inheritance that we must safeguard at every single turn. For the past four years, I have worked to do just that. From a great hall of Muslim leaders in Riyadh to a great square of Polish people in Warsaw; from the floor of the Korean Assembly to the podium at the United Nations General Assembly; and from the Forbidden City in Beijing to the shadow of Mount Rushmore, I fought for you, I fought for your family, I fought for our country. Above all, I fought for America and all it stands for — and that is safe, strong, proud, and free. Now, as I prepare to hand power over to a new administration at noon on Wednesday, I want you to know that the movement we started is only just beginning. There’s never been anything like it. The belief that a nation must serve its citizens will not dwindle but instead only grow stronger by the day. As long as the American people hold in their hearts deep and devoted love of country, then there is nothing that this nation cannot achieve. Our communities will flourish. Our people will be prosperous. Our traditions will be cherished. Our faith will be strong. And our future will be brighter than ever before. I go from this majestic place with a loyal and joyful heart, an optimistic spirit, and a supreme confidence that for our country and for our children, the best is yet to come. Thank you, and farewell. God bless you. God bless the United States of America. END</td>\n",

       "      <td>2:10 P.M. CST THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Thank you, everybody.  Great honor to be here.  We worked long and hard.  Please sit down.  We’ve worked long and hard to get this done.  They said it couldn’t be done, and we got it done.  One of the largest infrastructure projects in the history of our country. I’m honored to be here in the Rio Grande Valley with the courageous men and women of Customs and Border Patrol.  These people are incredible.  They’re really incredible.  I’ve gotten to know you very well over the last four years.  Many of you are friends from all of the work we did in designing the wall.  We got it exactly as you wanted it — everything — including your protective plate on top.  I’d say, “Why did we put that?”  And they said, “We need it for extra protection.”  Climb plate.  And we have everything you want.  It’s steel.  It’s concrete inside the steel.  And then it’s rebar — a lot of heavy rebar inside the concrete.  And it’s as strong as you’re going to get and strong as you can have.  But we gave you 100 percent of what you wanted.  So now you have no excuses.  I didn’t want you to have any excuses.  (Laughter.) And you set records.  And we can’t let the next administration even think about taking it down, if you can believe that.  I don’t think that will happen.  I think when you see what it does and how it’s so important for our country, nobody is going to be touching it.  And you are very proud of it, and you’re proud of the work you did, because we really designed it together. We’re joined together to celebrate a great achievement: the extraordinarily successful building of the wall on the southern border. Before we begin, I’d like to say that free speech is under assault like never before.  The 25th Amendment is of zero risk to me but will come back to haunt Joe Biden and the Biden administration.  As the expression goes: Be careful what you wish for.  The impeachment hoax is a continuation of the greatest and most vicious witch hunt in the history of our country, and it is causing tremendous anger and division and pain — far greater than most people will ever understand, which is very dangerous for the USA, especially at this very tender time. And now I’d like to briefly address the events of last week.  Millions of our citizens watched on Wednesday as a mob stormed the Capitol and trashed the halls of government.  As I have consistently said throughout my administration, we believe in respecting America’s history and traditions, not tearing them down.  We believe in the rule of law, not in violence or rioting. Because of the pandemic — horrible, horrible invisible enemy — and despite our tremendous success developing a vaccine years before it was thought evenly remotely possible.  Nobody thought it was going to be possible.  They said would take five years.  “Sir, it will take seven years.”  All of our scientists were saying — our advisors, “It will take 7 years, 5 years, 10 years maybe.”  Well, we did it just like I said we would.  And we had it out years and years before they thought it was possible.  And we’re now delivering it to states, including your state, where your governor and government are doing a terrific job in getting it administered in Texas.  And Florida is doing great.  Some of them are doing great.  Some aren’t doing as well, but they have all they can handle.  And we get it to them as fast as they need it, and even faster. But they’re calling it a “medical miracle.”  And this has been a difficult year and a very difficult election.  The pandemic has made it a very, very difficult year for our country and virtually every country all over the world. Now is the time for our nation to heal, and it’s time for peace and for calm.  Respect for law enforcement and the great people within law enforcement — so many are here — is the foundation of the MAGA agenda.  And we’re a nation of law, and we’re a nation of order.  That is why we’re here today, to talk about what we must do to uphold the rule of law in America and how we must continue to support our law enforcement heroes, which is exactly what you are.  Do you feel like a hero?  Yeah, I think you do.  Right?  (Applause.)  You do and you are. I want to thank Customs and Border Patrol Commissioner Mark Morgan, who’s been incredible.  Where is Mark?  Mark?  Stand up, Mark.  Great job.  Fantastic.  (Applause.) Chief Patrol Agent Brian Hastings.  Brian, thank you very much.  Great job.  (Applause.)  He’s so happy with it.  He said, “Sir, this really works.” And most importantly, the brave law enforcement officers who risk their lives every day to protect our families and our country. I also want to thank a tremendous gentleman, a friend of mine, Tom Homan.  He’s a great American patriot, and he was with us right from the beginning.  (Applause.)  Right, Tom?  You knew exactly — he said, “We need a wall,” when they were saying, “No, no, we need drones.  We need drones.”  I said, “Why?  So you can watch the people pour into our country illegally?”  And I want to thank you very much, Tom.  What a — what a professional job you’ve done. All of you people, incredible.  Everyone here today is part of an incredible success story.  This is a real success story. When I took office, we inherited a broken, dysfunctional, and open border.  Everybody was pouring in at will. Working alongside the heroes in this great outdoor space, looking at our wall, we reformed our immigration system and achieved the most secure southern border in U.S. history.  It is at a level that it’s never been before. We took on the cartels, the coyotes, and the special interests, and we restored the rule of law.  For years, politicians ran for office promising to secure the border, only to get elected and to do the absolute exact opposite.  They even promised a wall.  If you remember, about 10 years ago, they promised a wall but they couldn’t get it built.  It wasn’t easy getting it built.  Getting it financed was tough.  Getting it built was even tougher.  All the different chains of title and all the different things we had to go through — very, very complex and very difficult, but we got it done.  But they had it years ago.  You remember that better than anybody.  Right?  And they never got it done.  They never, ever completed the task.  And then, ultimately, the money was sent back to the federal government.  Spent, but no wall was built. But unlike those who came before me, I kept my promises.  And today we celebrate an extraordinary milestone: the completion of the promised 450 miles of border wall.  Four hundred and fifty miles.  Nobody realizes how big that is.  (Applause.) I remember when I first came down, about a year and a half ago: We’re under construction, and I started walking, and I’m looking at the wall, and I’m walking and walking.  And I’m used to, like, a development project where you could walk a wall.  You know, 10 acres, 5 acres, 2 acres, 1 acre.  Then I realized that’s a long time; that’s a big walk.  A lot of it — a lot of the wall you have is incredibly natural.  It’s — you have the mountains.  You have the rivers.  You have some very powerful water areas.  You have some areas that are virtually impossible to get by.  So we didn’t need walls everywhere, but where we needed them — because it’s been so successful that we’ve added nearly 300 miles.  And that’s currently under construction.  This was our original wish: to get these areas done where it was such trouble.  And now we have it.  It’s either in construction or pre-construction — an additional 300 miles. In every region that we’ve built the wall, illegal crossings and drug smuggling have plummeted.  Absolutely plummeted.  In the Rio Grande Valley, crossings have dropped nearly 80 percent.  In Yuma, Arizona, illegal entries have been slashed by 90 percent.  Nationwide, ICE and Border Patrol have seized over 2 million pounds of fentanyl, heroin, meth, and other deadly narcotics, saving thousands and thousands of lives. We’ve arrested nearly 500,000 illegal aliens with criminal records — some with very serious criminal records of the type you don’t want to know about, like murder. We removed nearly 20,000 gang members from the United States, including 4,500 members of MS-13 — probably the worst gang of them all.  Through the landmark reforms we’ve put into place, we have ended the immigration chaos and reestablished American sovereignty.  Our most important reform was ending catch and release — not easy to do; you’re dealing with Congress; it’s very, very difficult — which is the functional equivalent of open borders, but even worse: It’s catch and release them.  It means release into our country, not into another country. This policy was exploited by vicious criminal organizations, who understood the laws better than our people understood them for years, to spread misery and suffering and drugs all across the hemisphere. Now, instead of “catch and release,” we have “detain and remove.”  It’s called “detain and remove.”  Doesn’t that sound better?  One of the biggest loopholes we closed was asylum fraud.  Under the old, broken system, if you merely requested asylum, you were released into the country.  The most ridiculous thing anyone has ever seen.  And we were taking in some people that you didn’t want to have in your country. We instituted a series of historic policy changes to shut down asylum fraud, and that’s what we did.  This includes the groundbreaking agreement with Mexico known as the “Migrant Protection Protocols,” or MPP. Under this agreement, if an illegal alien requests asylum, they have to wait in Mexico until their case is heard.  They used to wait here.  And when they were waiting, they would say “bye-bye,” and they’d disappear somewhere into our country, and essentially we’d never find them again, would never see them again. This one measure alone ended a humanitarian crisis and saved countless lives, and especially, I have to say, lives from crime. I want to thank the great President of Mexico.  He is a great gentleman, a friend of mine.  And President Obrador — he is a man who really knows what’s happening.  And he loves his country, and he also loves the United States.  But I want to thank for his friendship and his professional working relationship. We actually had 27,000 Mexican soldiers guarding our borders over the last two years.  Nobody thought that was possible.  And they made it very, very difficult, and that’s why the numbers were able to plunge, even during the construction of the wall. And, by the way, one of the big elements of the wall that make it so successful is we can have far fewer people working.  Now, they can be working on other things — other things related to crime and drug prevention and a lot of other elements they’re working on, because we saved massive numbers of people.  And included here we have the most sophisticated camera systems and most sophisticated electronic systems anywhere in the world. We implemented three historic agreements with the Northern Triangle; that’s Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador.  Under these critical asylum cooperation agreements, the burden of illegal immigration is now shared all across the region.  Now, when an illegal immigrant is arrested at our border, they can be sent to a neighboring country instead of into a U.S. community. Prior to my getting here, countries wouldn’t accept them.  They would say, “No, no, no.”  I said, “Well, you got to take them.”  First month — I’ll never forget — these gentlemen, right here, came to me.  They said, “They won’t take them back.” They came.  They may be murderers.  They may be cartel heads.  They may be some really vicious people.  The countries didn’t want them back.  And I stopped all payments to those countries.  I stopped everything going to those countries.  And after it was stopped for about a month — you remember? — after it was stopped for about a month, they called.  They said, “We’d love to have them back.”  And I never gave them as much money as they were getting, by the way, but they got some.  (Applause.) It was amazing. And you people know better than anyone: They wouldn’t take them back.  We’d have planes flying over, loaded up with people that we didn’t want here.  And they’d say, “Don’t ever even think about landing that plane.”  And they’d take them by boat, and they’d take them by bus, and they wouldn’t let them into their countries.  And all of a sudden, they say, “Welcome back.  We love having you.” So it was a great thing.  And now they do take them back.  And the relationship with those countries — the Triangle — the relationship is a much better one than it was before. In addition to our agreements with Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador, we have systematically reformed the regulatory code to return asylum to its original legal meaning and purpose — not a free ticket for entry. A recent comprehensive report by the Department of Homeland Security and Justice show how effective our reforms have been and how disastrous their removal would be.  It would be a disaster for our country.  I know they’re thinking about removing them.  I hope they don’t do that.  I hope they don’t do that.  It’ll be a absolute travesty for our country. The report conclusively proves, once and for all, that aliens released at the border remain at large in the country and do not return home.  They won’t go home.  And you rarely find them.  It’s very tough to find them. So we have aliens released in our country, many of whom are serious criminals.  And we’ve stopped that.  Don’t ever start that process again.  By contrast, under our policies, 98 percent of aliens that remain in DHS custody are removed.  Simply put, if you enter the United States illegally, you are apprehended and immediately safely removed from our country.  Without this core principle, there is no border, there is no law, there is no order. My administration also instituted vital public health measures on the border.  In response to the China virus, under Title 42 of the U.S. Code, illegal immigrants are being promptly removed to protect the health of border agents, other migrants, and local communities, and the public at large.  Removing these protections would invite a public health catastrophe of epic proportions. As you probably know, in Tijuana, various parts of Mexico, the COVID — it’s got about 24 names I can call it, from “COVID” to “China virus.”  I can call it the “plague.”  I call it the “China plague.”  A lot of different names.  But we always call it the “invisible enemy.”  But the invisible enemy has been very tough on Mexico, and we have areas along the border where we’re in great shape because right there, because of that, that we’re in great shape.  But on the other side, in Mexico, they’re suffering greatly with the virus.  It’s been incredible what we’ve achieved.  And we didn’t do the wall because of COVID; we did the wall because of security and drugs and other things.  But it turned out that, in the middle of it all, along came this horrible plague. We inherited a dangerously lawless border.  The people that work here are unbelievably brave.  I’ve seen what they have to endure, what they have to go through.  They’re tough, they’re strong, and they’re great patriots, great Americans. We fixed it and we secured it.  We empowered our wonderful ICE and Border Patrol to fulfill their oaths and sworn officers.  They became sworn officers of the law.  And they love their job.  It’s a tough job.  It’s a nasty job.  They’re not paid what they should be paid, to be honest, but we got you up.  We got you up.  But these are incredibly talented people that could probably do a lot better, in terms of economics, than they do here.  But they love what they do, and they love their country. We also put into place vital measures to protect American workers, keep out terrorists, and stop the abuse of our welfare system — where they’d come up, go on our welfare system, and live for years on American welfare without ever having a job. We also have, and we had — but we have them all the time — we have terrorists from the Middle East coming into our country through the southern border.  That was before what you see right here, because it was easier to come into our country through the southern border than it was through airports or any other means.  So they’d land in South America, and they’d work their way up, and they’d come into our country.  And these are not people from the countries that you would suspect.  These are people from some very seriously dangerous places in the Middle East.  And the numbers are far greater than anybody would understand.  Really far greater. Removing any of these measures would hamstring our workers, endanger our country, and cost taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars a year. No matter our party, we should all agree on the need to protect our workers, our families, and our citizens of all backgrounds, no matter who they are.  In particular, if our border security measures are reversed, it will trigger a tidal wave of illegal immigration — a wave like you’ve never seen before.  And I can tell you that, already, waves are starting to come up from 2,000 and 1,000 and 500 miles away.  We see what’s coming. And they’re coming because they think that it’s gravy train at the end; it’s going to be a gravy train.  Change the name from the “caravans,” which I think we came up with, to the “gravy train,” because that’s what they’re looking for — looking for the gravy. This will be an unmitigated calamity for national security, public safety, and public health.  It would destroy millions and millions of jobs and claim thousands of innocent lives.  The policies I put into place are uniformly and strongly supported by the men and women of ICE and Border Patrol.  We worked on them together, just like we did on the wall.  We worked on the policies together because nobody knows this whole world better than the incredible people right in front of me.  To terminate those policies is knowingly to put America in really serious danger and to override the great career experts that have worked so hard — those from DHS. At this very moment, smugglers and coyotes are preparing to surge the border if our policies are loosened or removed.  I mean, they’re literally waiting — big, big groups of people.  Some of them very unsavory, I might add. This is an entirely preventable tragedy.  It’s waiting to happen.  The safety of our nation must come before politics.  We have many disagreements in the country, but we should all agree: the urgent need to secure our borders, protect our homeland, and allow law enforcement to fulfill its mission without political interference. ICE and Border Patrol agents swore a sacred oath to uphold the law, and no political appointee should ever order them to violate that oath.  These are real experts.  They really get it. And I’ll tell you who else gets it: The Hispanic population of our country gets it.  Because not only did I win Texas in historic numbers, but I won border towns, which are largely Hispanic, and people were amazed to see that.  And the numbers, they say, were — the Governor of Texas called — Greg — great guy, great governor — called.  He said, “You had numbers that nobody has had since Reconstruction.  “Reconstruction” means “Civil War.”  And largely Hispanic.  They understand it better than anybody, and they want law enforcement to help them — help them live safe lives. The laws that Congress passed must be upheld.  To the men and women of ICE, Customs and Border Protection, and all across DHS, law enforcement in general: You have earned the everlasting gratitude of our nation.  You have no idea how much our nation loves you and respects you.  I don’t think you do have an idea, but it’s true.  I only hope and pray that your voice will be heard, honored, heeded, and respected long into the future. God bless you.  God bless law enforcement.  And God bless America.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Great job.  (Applause.)</td>\n",

I’ve been predicting it for a long time, and people didn’t act on it. But I think big tech has made a terrible mistake, and very, very bad for our country.

I’ve never seen such anger as I see right now, and that’s a terrible thing. Terrible thing. And you have to always avoid violence. And we have — we have tremendous support. Q What is your role, sir? THE PRESIDENT: We have support probably like nobody has ever seen before. Always have to avoid violence. Q Mr. President, what is your role in what happened at the Capitol? What is your personal responsibility? THE PRESIDENT: So if you read my speech — and many people have done it, and I’ve seen it both in the papers and in the media, on television — it’s been analyzed, and people thought that what I said was totally appropriate. And if you look at what other people have said — politicians at a high level — about the riots during the summer, the horrible riots in Portland and Seattle, in various other — other places, that was a real problem — what they said.

It would normally take five years, six years, seven years, or even more. In order to achieve this goal, we harnessed the full power of government, the genius of American scientists, and the might of American industry to save millions and millions of lives all over the world. We’re just days away from authorization from the FDA, and we’re pushing them hard, at which point we will immediately begin mass distribution. Before Operation Warp Speed, the typical timeframe for development and approval, as you know, could be infinity. And we were very, very happy that we were able to get things done at a level that nobody has ever seen before. The gold standard vaccine has been done in less than nine months. On behalf of the entire nation, I want to thank everyone here today who has been involved in this extraordinary American initiative. I also want to recognize members of my administration who have worked tirelessly in this effort: Alex Azar. Please, Alex. Where’s Alex? Thank you, Alex. Great job. (Applause.) Moncef Slaoui. Where are you, Moncef? Thank you very much. Great job. (Applause.) A man who’s now going to be very important, General Gus Perna. I have no doubt about it, right? (Applause.) Logistics. Jared Kushner. He’s worked so hard. Where’s Jared? Jared, wherever you may be. Thank you. Thank you, Jared. (Applause.) Dr. Deborah Birx. Deborah? Thank you very much, Deborah. (Applause.) Admiral Brett Giroir. Where is Brett? (Applause.) Great job you’ve been doing, Brett. Surgeon General Jerome Adams. (Applause.) Jerome, thank you very much. Terrific. Dr. Robert Redfield. (Applause.) Robert, thank you very much. Appreciate it. Administrator Seema Verma. Seema? Thank you. (Applause.)\\nDr. Peter Marks. Peter? Where’s Peter? Thank you. (Applause.)\\nPaul Mango, Adam Boehler, and Brad Smith — thank you very much. Great job. (Applause.) Thank you all very much. Incredible job. And many others, also. Many, many others. We’re also grateful to be joined by Governors Greg Abbott. Where’s Greg? (Applause.) Bill Lee. Bill? (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Bill. Ron DeSantis. Ron? (Applause.) Thank you, Ron. Thank you. Thank you very much. Great job, Ron. And John Bel Edwards. John Bel. Thank you. (Applause.) Thank you, John Bel. Thank you very much. As well as Senator John Barrasso, who is a fantastic doctor, also, by the way, I have to say. (Applause.) When we — when I need info on that subject, I call up John. Thank you, John, very much. Senator Steve Daines. Congratulations on a great win. Great win. (Applause.) That was easier than you thought, it turned out, right? It was a little easier than you thought. Great going. We’re proud of you. Congressman Greg Walden. Greg, thank you very much. (Applause.) Thank you very much. And Congressman Brad Wenstrup. Thank you, Brad. (Applause.) Great job. And many, many others. My administration provided a total of $14 billion to accelerate vaccine development and to manufacture all of the top candidates in advance — long in advance. As a result of this unprecedented investment, we are exceedingly proud that both Pfizer and Moderna have announced that their vaccines are approximately 95 percent effective, which is a number that nobody expected to be able to get to, far exceeding anything that really we — that anybody thought. We went out and we said, “What do you think a maximum would be?” And I think doctors — we all came up to the conclusion that something like that would be really incredible. And we have other candidates looking right now. We have some big ones that we’re going to be announcing very soon. We have some companies — great, great companies out there you all know about: Johnson &amp; Johnson and — and others. And they’re all coming in, and they’re coming in very quickly. We expect to have some news on that very shortly. And we have worked very well with the companies, but if for any reason we have any problems, we will be instituting the Defense Production Act, and we will make sure that we don’t have any problems for very long. We’ve instituted it before. Two additional companies, AstraZeneca and Johnson &amp; Johnson — as you know, the Johnson &amp; Johnson is a one-dose, one-shot vaccine, so we’re going to see how that works. That would be very helpful if that all came out, and I think it probably will. Also, they’re showing tremendous — tremendous promise, all of them. Tremendous prob- — We’re — we’re very hopeful that the FDA will authorize the Pfizer vaccine within days. We got to get it moving. And Moderna vaccine almost immediately thereafter. Large numbers of tests and samples have been done, so hopefully that’ll go very quickly. If authorized, tens of millions of vaccine doses will be available this month. And we’ll get it distributed very quickly. We have that all set. And hundreds of millions more will quickly follow. Every American who wants the vaccine will be able to get the vaccine. And we think by spring we’re going to be in a position that nobody would have believed possible just a few months ago. (Applause.) Yeah. Amazing. Really amazing. They say it’s — they say it’s somewhat of a miracle, and I think that’s true. The plan we put forward prioritizes the elderly and patients with underlying conditions, as well as healthcare workers and first responders. The ultimate decision rests with the governors of the various states — and I hope the governors make wise decisions — who will decide where the vaccines will go in their state and who will get them first. We urge the governors to put America’s seniors first, and also, I think those who work with seniors, which obviously you’re going to have to do that. I think they have to go together. And doctors, nurses, first responders, et cetera. This will quickly and dramatically reduce deaths and hospitalizations. And within a short period of time, I think we want to get back to normal. A very standard phrase. We want to just get back to normal, get back to where we were a little more than nine months ago. We were doing incredibly. And in many respects, we’re still doing incredibly with our stock markets and everything else, which are hitting all new highs. We’ve already finalized a partnership with Walgreens and CVS, whose executives join us today. Thank you very much for being here. Thank you very much. We appreciate it very much. (Applause.) And they will deliver vaccines directly to nursing homes as soon as the states request that they do so. Later today, General Gus Perna will outline the detailed plan to rapidly distribute the vaccine to every state, territory, and tribe. States have designated over 50,000 sites that will receive the vaccine. We’ve worked very closely with the states. Actually, we’ve had very good relationships with the governors — I almost think all of the governors — at least in those conference calls that are somewhat secret, other than sometimes on occasion, Mike, the press will break in, which is fine too. (Laughter.) It’s amazing how you leave those rooms and about 10 seconds later — there wasn’t even time for a leak — they were on the call. (Laughter.) But that’s all right. So you assume that. You always assume that. But they’ll be going through pharmacies, hospitals, healthcare providers. Through our partnership with FedEx, UPS, and McKesson, we’ll ship doses from warehouses directly to the designated sites. And we’re thrilled to be joined by representatives of those, really, great American companies. Those companies have worked with us, and they’ve been incredible to work with. And I want to thank you all for being here. Please, thank you very much. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you very much. As I’ve stated all along — and I guess as you saw pretty vividly. I heard about the — I heard about what they — we’re going to show prior to my coming. You saw that very few people thought that this was possible. Of course, they’ll be saying now, “We always told you it was so.” But we have them saying a little bit different. But it has been incredible. And it will end the pandemic. It will end the pandemic. And we’re working with other nations. As you see actually by looking at your screen today, we’re working very closely with other nations also to get the vaccines out to other nations. And that’s very important. We work with the world. We’re working with the world. We have great companies, and we’re working with the world. In just a few minutes, I’ll sign an executive order to ensure that the United States government prioritizes the getting out of the vaccine to American citizens before sending it to other nations. Now, if necessary, I told you, we’ll invoke the Defense Production Act, but we don’t think it will be necessary. If it is — it’s a very powerful act, as you know, because we’ve used it very, very successfully. While we begin to swiftly deploy the vaccine, we’ll continue to expand the availability of groundbreaking therapies. Since April, advances in treatments have already helped reduce the mortality rate by 85 percent. Think of that: 85 percent. (Applause.) It’s an incredible number. I’ve delivered on my solemn promise to make the antibody treatments — they’re brilliant; they’re highly successful — available to every American, and we’re doing that free of cost — totally free of cost. So we’re making them available, and they’re available now. And if somebody gets sick, it works, where they go and they get treatment if that’s what the doctors are prescribing. And it’s been incredible, the success. And when you hear 85 percent, that’s some number. To me, that’s a number that goes along with anything else, including the vaccines, when you think about it. As well as we’ve done with the vaccines, when you hear “85 percent,” people — people find that one hard to believe. But you look at the stats, and you see what’s happening. And you look at other countries; they’re having tremendous difficulties in Europe — tremendous. Beyond — relatively beyond what we’re having. They’re having them all over the world. But this will vanquish the — the problem, this horrible scourge — as I call it, the “China virus,” because that’s where it came from. The virus has really been looked at and studied all over the world, and our scientists, our industrial and economic mobilization has been like nobody else in the world could have done. And it’s very important that we share that with others and other nations. I’ve worked and invoked the Defense Production Act over 100 times to manufacture essential supplies in the United States. Despite the grim projections from the media eight months ago, where they said this was impossible — they actually said — and you saw that a little bit, but I could give you two hours’ worth of it. But they said it will never happen; you could never do it; it was a pipe dream. But we — we did something that nobody thought was possible. And we also did it where no American who has needed a ventilator has been denied a ventilator. When we — when this first came out, we weren’t equipped for that. Nobody was equipped for that. And we’re now making ventilators. And we have all we need in this country, but we’re sending them to countries all over the world. We’re making thousands and thousands of ventilators a month. The United States has also created the largest, most advanced, and most innovative testing program in the world by far. We’ve conducted over 200 million tests. Think of that: 200 million tests — more than all of the European Union combined. It’s not even close. Just 10 months ago, none of these innovations even existed. The tremendous progress that we’ve made is a testament to what our nation is capable of. When America is faced with a challenge, we come through — and we always come through — to overcome every hardship and surmount every obstacle. And I think you’ll be seeing that over the next few months; the numbers should skyrocket downward. We are the most exceptional nation in the history of the world. Today, we’re on the verge of another American medical miracle. And that’s what people are saying. People that aren’t necessarily big fans of Donald Trump are saying, “Whether you like him or not, this is one of the greatest miracles in the history of modern-day medicine” or any other medicine — any other age of medicine. American companies were the first to produce a verifiably safe and effective vaccine. Together, we will defeat the virus, and we will soon end the pandemic, and we will save millions and millions of lives, both in our country and all over the world. And we’ve already started. Thank you again to every person here today and for the incredible achievements that you’ve done. You’re going to be very proud of this day, and you’re going to be very proud of this period of time because nobody thought this was possible. Nobody thought it was even remotely possible to do what we’ve done in a period of less than nine months — something that — just not even thinkable. And we took a lot of heat when we said this is our goal, and we, frankly, weren’t even quite using the numbers that we used. We far exceeded what we thought. If we would have said “sometime next year,” I think most people would have said, “That would be great. That would be a miracle.” But we did it long before sometime next year. So now I want to ask several leaders who have been crucial in this effort to join me on stage as I sign the executive order to ensure that American citizens have first priority to receive American vaccines. And then we’re going to be working with other countries all over the world, and I think we’ll be able to start doing that almost immediately also, because we have millions of doses coming in. So thank you very much. Thank you. It’s a great honor. (Applause.) (The executive order is signed.) So, let’s see here. I guess we have to do our Vice President, right? (Applause.) AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you, Mr. President. THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. (Applause.) Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you. (Applause.) Any questions, please? (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you all. (Applause.) Any questions, please? A question? Yes, please. Q Mr. President, it’s clearly a success, this vaccine. I’m wondering, though, what your message is to the American people, given all of the increasing cases right now, about what they should do over Christmas and the hardship that they’re all facing as this virus does get worse. THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, well, CDC puts out their guidelines, and they’re very important guidelines, but I think this: I think that the vaccine was our goal. That was number one because that was the way — that was the way it ends. Plus, you do have an immunity. You develop immunity over a period of time, and I hear we’re close to 15 percent. I’m hearing that, and that is terrific. That’s a very powerful vaccine in itself. And just tremendous progress has been made. One of the reasons we do show so many — and I say this, and I’ve been saying it for a long time — so many cases is because of the fact that we have 200 million tests. And you take — I think India is actually in second place with just a fraction of that number. So we’re many times greater than the second country, and India has 1.4 billion people where — our testing program has been incredible. And we actually are also coming out with new tests very shortly that will make the process even easier, and you won’t need doctors necessarily to do the test. So we have some incredible tests coming out in a very short period of time. Yeah, please. Q Mr. President, some of these scientific officials here in this room have encouraged Americans not to travel this holiday season, not to go to large gatherings. Across the street, you’ve been holding holiday parties with hundreds of people, many not wearing masks. Why are you modeling a different behavior to the American people than what your scientists tell? THE PRESIDENT: Well, they’re Christmas parties, and frankly, we’ve reduced the number very substantially, as you know. And I see a lot of people at the parties wearing masks. I mean, I would say that I look out at the audience at those parties, and we have a lot of people wearing masks, and I think that’s a good thing. Yeah, please. Over here. Go ahead. Q The next administration will be the one, ultimately, that implements a lot of the distribution of this vaccine and will oversee much of the future of the way Operation Warp Speed goes forward. Why not include members of the Biden transition team as part of this summit that you’re hosting today? THE PRESIDENT: Well, we’re going to have to see who the next administration is — because we won in those swing states, and there was terrible things that went on. So we’re going to have to see who the next administration is. But whichever the next administration is will really benefit by what we’ve been able to do with this incredible science, the doctors — all of the people that came up — the lab technicians. The wor- — the work that’s been done is incredible, and it will be incredible for the next administration. And hopefully the next administration will be the Trump administration, because you can’t steal hundreds of thousands of votes. You can’t have fraud and deception and all of the things that they did, and then slightly win a swing state. And you just have to look at the numbers. Look at what’s been on tape. Look at all the corruption. And we’ll see. You can’t win an election like that. So hopefully the next administration will be the Trump administration, a continuation — which has led us to the highest stock markets we’ve ever had, the best employment numbers we’ve ever had, a rebuilt military. If you look at — the tax reductions are the greatest in history; the regulation reductions, the greatest in history. It leads us to Space Force, which nobody thought was possible. All of the things we’ve done. And we were rewarded with a victory. Now, let’s see whether or not somebody has the courage — whether it’s a legislator or legislatures, or whether it’s a justice of the Supreme Court or a number of justices of the Supreme Court. Let’s see if they have the courage to do what everybody in this country knows is right. I received almost 75 million votes, the highest number of votes in the history of our country for a sitting President — 12 million more than the 63 million we received four years ago. President Obama received 3 million less in his second term, and he won easily. I received 12 million more, which, by the way, is a record. Twelve million more. And they say that when the numbers came out — and the numbers came through machines. And all of those ballots were taken away and added. All you have to do is turn on your local television set and you’ll see what happened with thousands of ballots coming out from under tables — with all of the terrible things you saw. All you have to do is take a look. And if somebody has the courage, I know who the next administration will be. And I’ll tell you what: Life will be much easier for this country because of what we’ve done right now and because of a lot of the people in this room. The job you’ve done on the vaccine, together with a lot of others, has been a modern-day miracle, and it’s really been acknowledged as such. And I want to thank you. I want to give you my love, and I want to give you my thanks because you’re very special people. And now, good luck. You distribute that, General, and really set records. Okay? Set records, just like we’ve been doing for four years. Thank you very much. Thank you, everybody. Thank you. (Applause.) END 2:28 P.M. EST</td>\n",

In short, we embarked on a mission to make America great again — for all Americans. As I conclude my term as the 45th President of the United States, I stand before you truly proud of what we have achieved together. We did what we came here to do — and so much more. This week, we inaugurate a new administration and pray for its success in keeping America safe and prosperous. We extend our best wishes, and we also want them to have luck — a very important word. I’d like to begin by thanking just a few of the amazing people who made our remarkable journey possible. First, let me express my overwhelming gratitude for the love and support of our spectacular First Lady, Melania. Let me also share my deepest appreciation to my daughter Ivanka, my son-in-law Jared, and to Barron, Don, Eric, Tiffany, and Lara. You fill my world with light and with joy. I also want to thank Vice President Mike Pence, his wonderful wife Karen, and the entire Pence family. Thank you as well to my Chief of Staff, Mark Meadows; the dedicated members of the White House Staff and the Cabinet; and all the incredible people across our administration who poured out their heart and soul to fight for America. I also want to take a moment to thank a truly exceptional group of people: the United States Secret Service. My family and I will forever be in your debt. My profound gratitude as well to everyone in the White House Military Office, the teams of Marine One and Air Force One, every member of the Armed Forces, and state and local law enforcement all across our country. Most of all, I want to thank the American people. To serve as your President has been an honor beyond description. Thank you for this extraordinary privilege. And that’s what it is — a great privilege and a great honor. We must never forget that while Americans will always have our disagreements, we are a nation of incredible, decent, faithful, and peace-loving citizens who all want our country to thrive and flourish and be very, very successful and good. We are a truly magnificent nation. All Americans were horrified by the assault on our Capitol. Political violence is an attack on everything we cherish as Americans. It can never be tolerated. Now more than ever, we must unify around our shared values and rise above the partisan rancor, and forge our common destiny. Four years ago, I came to Washington as the only true outsider ever to win the presidency. I had not spent my career as a politician, but as a builder looking at open skylines and imagining infinite possibilities. I ran for President because I knew there were towering new summits for America just waiting to be scaled. I knew the potential for our nation was boundless as long as we put America first. So I left behind my former life and stepped into a very difficult arena, but an arena nevertheless, with all sorts of potential if properly done. America had given me so much, and I wanted to give something back. Together with millions of hardworking patriots across this land, we built the greatest political movement in the history of our country. We also built the greatest economy in the history of the world. It was about “America First” because we all wanted to make America great again. We restored the principle that a nation exists to serve its citizens. Our agenda was not about right or left, it wasn’t about Republican or Democrat, but about the good of a nation, and that means the whole nation. With the support and prayers of the American people, we achieved more than anyone thought possible. Nobody thought we could even come close. We passed the largest package of tax cuts and reforms in American history. We slashed more job-killing regulations than any administration had ever done before. We fixed our broken trade deals, withdrew from the horrible Trans-Pacific Partnership and the impossible Paris Climate Accord, renegotiated the one-sided South Korea deal, and we replaced NAFTA with the groundbreaking USMCA — that’s Mexico and Canada — a deal that’s worked out very, very well. Also, and very importantly, we imposed historic and monumental tariffs on China; made a great new deal with China. But before the ink was even dry, we and the whole world got hit with the China virus. Our trade relationship was rapidly changing, billions and billions of dollars were pouring into the U.S., but the virus forced us to go in a different direction. The whole world suffered, but America outperformed other countries economically because of our incredible economy and the economy that we built. Without the foundations and footings, it wouldn’t have worked out this way. We wouldn’t have some of the best numbers we’ve ever had. We also unlocked our energy resources and became the world’s number-one producer of oil and natural gas by far. Powered by these policies, we built the greatest economy in the history of the world. We reignited America’s job creation and achieved record-low unemployment for African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, women — almost everyone. Incomes soared, wages boomed, the American Dream was restored, and millions were lifted from poverty in just a few short years. It was a miracle. The stock market set one record after another, with 148 stock market highs during this short period of time, and boosted the retirements and pensions of hardworking citizens all across our nation. 401(k)s are at a level they’ve never been at before. We’ve never seen numbers like we’ve seen, and that’s before the pandemic and after the pandemic. We rebuilt the American manufacturing base, opened up thousands of new factories, and brought back the beautiful phrase: “Made in the USA.” To make life better for working families, we doubled the child tax credit and signed the largest-ever expansion of funding for childcare and development. We joined with the private sector to secure commitments to train more than 16 million American workers for the jobs of tomorrow. When our nation was hit with the terrible pandemic, we produced not one, but two vaccines with record-breaking speed, and more will quickly follow. They said it couldn’t be done but we did it. They call it a “medical miracle,” and that’s what they’re calling it right now: a “medical miracle.” Another administration would have taken 3, 4, 5, maybe even up to 10 years to develop a vaccine. We did in nine months. We grieve for every life lost, and we pledge in their memory to wipe out this horrible pandemic once and for all. When the virus took its brutal toll on the world’s economy, we launched the fastest economic recovery our country has ever seen. We passed nearly $4 trillion in economic relief, saved or supported over 50 million jobs, and slashed the unemployment rate in half. These are numbers that our country has never seen before. We created choice and transparency in healthcare, stood up to big pharma in so many ways, but especially in our effort to get favored-nations clauses added, which will give us the lowest prescription drug prices anywhere in the world. We passed VA Choice, VA Accountability, Right to Try, and landmark criminal justice reform. We confirmed three new justices of the United States Supreme Court. We appointed nearly 300 federal judges to interpret our Constitution as written. For years, the American people pleaded with Washington to finally secure the nation’s borders. I am pleased to say we answered that plea and achieved the most secure border in U.S. history. We have given our brave border agents and heroic ICE officers the tools they need to do their jobs better than they have ever done before, and to enforce our laws and keep America safe. We proudly leave the next administration with the strongest and most robust border security measures ever put into place. This includes historic agreements with Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador, along with more than 450 miles of powerful new wall. We restored American strength at home and American leadership abroad. The world respects us again. Please don’t lose that respect. We reclaimed our sovereignty by standing up for America at the United Nations and withdrawing from the one-sided global deals that never served our interests. And NATO countries are now paying hundreds of billions of dollars more than when I arrived just a few years ago. It was very unfair. We were paying the cost for the world. Now the world is helping us. And perhaps most importantly of all, with nearly $3 trillion, we fully rebuilt the American military — all made in the USA. We launched the first new branch of the United States Armed Forces in 75 years: the Space Force. And last spring, I stood at Kennedy Space Center in Florida and watched as American astronauts returned to space on American rockets for the first time in many, many years. We revitalized our alliances and rallied the nations of the world to stand up to China like never before. We obliterated the ISIS caliphate and ended the wretched life of its founder and leader, al Baghdadi. We stood up to the oppressive Iranian regime and killed the world’s top terrorist, Iranian butcher Qasem Soleimani. We recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. As a result of our bold diplomacy and principled realism, we achieved a series of historic peace deals in the Middle East. Nobody believed it could happen. The Abraham Accords opened the doors to a future of peace and harmony, not violence and bloodshed. It is the dawn of a new Middle East, and we are bringing our soldiers home. I am especially proud to be the first President in decades who has started no new wars. Above all, we have reasserted the sacred idea that, in America, the government answers to the people. Our guiding light, our North Star, our unwavering conviction has been that we are here to serve the noble everyday citizens of America. Our allegiance is not to the special interests, corporations, or global entities; it’s to our children, our citizens, and to our nation itself. As President, my top priority, my constant concern, has always been the best interests of American workers and American families. I did not seek the easiest course; by far, it was actually the most difficult. I did not seek the path that would get the least criticism. I took on the tough battles, the hardest fights, the most difficult choices because that’s what you elected me to do. Your needs were my first and last unyielding focus. This, I hope, will be our greatest legacy: Together, we put the American people back in charge of our country. We restored self-government. We restored the idea that in America no one is forgotten, because everyone matters and everyone has a voice. We fought for the principle that every citizen is entitled to equal dignity, equal treatment, and equal rights because we are all made equal by God. Everyone is entitled to be treated with respect, to have their voice heard, and to have their government listen. You are loyal to your country, and my administration was always loyal to you. We worked to build a country in which every citizen could find a great job and support their wonderful families. We fought for the communities where every American could be safe and schools where every child could learn. We promoted a culture where our laws would be upheld, our heroes honored, our history preserved, and law-abiding citizens are never taken for granted. Americans should take tremendous satisfaction in all that we have achieved together. It’s incredible. Now, as I leave the White House, I have been reflecting on the dangers that threaten the priceless inheritance we all share. As the world’s most powerful nation, America faces constant threats and challenges from abroad. But the greatest danger we face is a loss of confidence in ourselves, a loss of confidence in our national greatness. A nation is only as strong as its spirit. We are only as dynamic as our pride. We are only as vibrant as the faith that beats in the hearts of our people. No nation can long thrive that loses faith in its own values, history, and heroes, for these are the very sources of our unity and our vitality. What has always allowed America to prevail and triumph over the great challenges of the past has been an unyielding and unashamed conviction in the nobility of our country and its unique purpose in history. We must never lose this conviction. We must never forsake our belief in America. The key to national greatness lies in sustaining and instilling our shared national identity. That means focusing on what we have in common: the heritage that we all share. At the center of this heritage is also a robust belief in free expression, free speech, and open debate. Only if we forget who we are, and how we got here, could we ever allow political censorship and blacklisting to take place in America. It’s not even thinkable. Shutting down free and open debate violates our core values and most enduring traditions.\\nIn America, we don’t insist on absolute conformity or enforce rigid orthodoxies and punitive speech codes. We just don’t do that. America is not a timid nation of tame souls who need to be sheltered and protected from those with whom we disagree. That’s not who we are. It will never be who we are. For nearly 250 years, in the face of every challenge, Americans have always summoned our unmatched courage, confidence, and fierce independence. These are the miraculous traits that once led millions of everyday citizens to set out across a wild continent and carve out a new life in the great West. It was the same profound love of our God-given freedom that willed our soldiers into battle and our astronauts into space. As I think back on the past four years, one image rises in my mind above all others. Whenever I traveled all along the motorcade route, there were thousands and thousands of people. They came out with their families so that they could stand as we passed, and proudly wave our great American flag. It never failed to deeply move me. I knew that they did not just come out to show their support of me; they came out to show me their support and love for our country. This is a republic of proud citizens who are united by our common conviction that America is the greatest nation in all of history. We are, and must always be, a land of hope, of light, and of glory to all the world. This is the precious inheritance that we must safeguard at every single turn. For the past four years, I have worked to do just that. From a great hall of Muslim leaders in Riyadh to a great square of Polish people in Warsaw; from the floor of the Korean Assembly to the podium at the United Nations General Assembly; and from the Forbidden City in Beijing to the shadow of Mount Rushmore, I fought for you, I fought for your family, I fought for our country. Above all, I fought for America and all it stands for — and that is safe, strong, proud, and free. Now, as I prepare to hand power over to a new administration at noon on Wednesday, I want you to know that the movement we started is only just beginning. There’s never been anything like it. The belief that a nation must serve its citizens will not dwindle but instead only grow stronger by the day. As long as the American people hold in their hearts deep and devoted love of country, then there is nothing that this nation cannot achieve. Our communities will flourish. Our people will be prosperous. Our traditions will be cherished. Our faith will be strong. And our future will be brighter than ever before. I go from this majestic place with a loyal and joyful heart, an optimistic spirit, and a supreme confidence that for our country and for our children, the best is yet to come. Thank you, and farewell. God bless you. God bless the United States of America. END  \n",
       "1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       2:10 P.M. CST THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Thank you, everybody.  Great honor to be here.  We worked long and hard.  Please sit down.  We’ve worked long and hard to get this done.  They said it couldn’t be done, and we got it done.  One of the largest infrastructure projects in the history of our country. I’m honored to be here in the Rio Grande Valley with the courageous men and women of Customs and Border Patrol.  These people are incredible.  They’re really incredible.  I’ve gotten to know you very well over the last four years.  Many of you are friends from all of the work we did in designing the wall.  We got it exactly as you wanted it — everything — including your protective plate on top.  I’d say, “Why did we put that?”  And they said, “We need it for extra protection.”  Climb plate.  And we have everything you want.  It’s steel.  It’s concrete inside the steel.  And then it’s rebar — a lot of heavy rebar inside the concrete.  And it’s as strong as you’re going to get and strong as you can have.  But we gave you 100 percent of what you wanted.  So now you have no excuses.  I didn’t want you to have any excuses.  (Laughter.) And you set records.  And we can’t let the next administration even think about taking it down, if you can believe that.  I don’t think that will happen.  I think when you see what it does and how it’s so important for our country, nobody is going to be touching it.  And you are very proud of it, and you’re proud of the work you did, because we really designed it together. We’re joined together to celebrate a great achievement: the extraordinarily successful building of the wall on the southern border. Before we begin, I’d like to say that free speech is under assault like never before.  The 25th Amendment is of zero risk to me but will come back to haunt Joe Biden and the Biden administration.  As the expression goes: Be careful what you wish for.  The impeachment hoax is a continuation of the greatest and most vicious witch hunt in the history of our country, and it is causing tremendous anger and division and pain — far greater than most people will ever understand, which is very dangerous for the USA, especially at this very tender time. And now I’d like to briefly address the events of last week.  Millions of our citizens watched on Wednesday as a mob stormed the Capitol and trashed the halls of government.  As I have consistently said throughout my administration, we believe in respecting America’s history and traditions, not tearing them down.  We believe in the rule of law, not in violence or rioting. Because of the pandemic — horrible, horrible invisible enemy — and despite our tremendous success developing a vaccine years before it was thought evenly remotely possible.  Nobody thought it was going to be possible.  They said would take five years.  “Sir, it will take seven years.”  All of our scientists were saying — our advisors, “It will take 7 years, 5 years, 10 years maybe.”  Well, we did it just like I said we would.  And we had it out years and years before they thought it was possible.  And we’re now delivering it to states, including your state, where your governor and government are doing a terrific job in getting it administered in Texas.  And Florida is doing great.  Some of them are doing great.  Some aren’t doing as well, but they have all they can handle.  And we get it to them as fast as they need it, and even faster. But they’re calling it a “medical miracle.”  And this has been a difficult year and a very difficult election.  The pandemic has made it a very, very difficult year for our country and virtually every country all over the world. Now is the time for our nation to heal, and it’s time for peace and for calm.  Respect for law enforcement and the great people within law enforcement — so many are here — is the foundation of the MAGA agenda.  And we’re a nation of law, and we’re a nation of order.  That is why we’re here today, to talk about what we must do to uphold the rule of law in America and how we must continue to support our law enforcement heroes, which is exactly what you are.  Do you feel like a hero?  Yeah, I think you do.  Right?  (Applause.)  You do and you are. I want to thank Customs and Border Patrol Commissioner Mark Morgan, who’s been incredible.  Where is Mark?  Mark?  Stand up, Mark.  Great job.  Fantastic.  (Applause.) Chief Patrol Agent Brian Hastings.  Brian, thank you very much.  Great job.  (Applause.)  He’s so happy with it.  He said, “Sir, this really works.” And most importantly, the brave law enforcement officers who risk their lives every day to protect our families and our country. I also want to thank a tremendous gentleman, a friend of mine, Tom Homan.  He’s a great American patriot, and he was with us right from the beginning.  (Applause.)  Right, Tom?  You knew exactly — he said, “We need a wall,” when they were saying, “No, no, we need drones.  We need drones.”  I said, “Why?  So you can watch the people pour into our country illegally?”  And I want to thank you very much, Tom.  What a — what a professional job you’ve done. All of you people, incredible.  Everyone here today is part of an incredible success story.  This is a real success story. When I took office, we inherited a broken, dysfunctional, and open border.  Everybody was pouring in at will. Working alongside the heroes in this great outdoor space, looking at our wall, we reformed our immigration system and achieved the most secure southern border in U.S. history.  It is at a level that it’s never been before. We took on the cartels, the coyotes, and the special interests, and we restored the rule of law.  For years, politicians ran for office promising to secure the border, only to get elected and to do the absolute exact opposite.  They even promised a wall.  If you remember, about 10 years ago, they promised a wall but they couldn’t get it built.  It wasn’t easy getting it built.  Getting it financed was tough.  Getting it built was even tougher.  All the different chains of title and all the different things we had to go through — very, very complex and very difficult, but we got it done.  But they had it years ago.  You remember that better than anybody.  Right?  And they never got it done.  They never, ever completed the task.  And then, ultimately, the money was sent back to the federal government.  Spent, but no wall was built. But unlike those who came before me, I kept my promises.  And today we celebrate an extraordinary milestone: the completion of the promised 450 miles of border wall.  Four hundred and fifty miles.  Nobody realizes how big that is.  (Applause.) I remember when I first came down, about a year and a half ago: We’re under construction, and I started walking, and I’m looking at the wall, and I’m walking and walking.  And I’m used to, like, a development project where you could walk a wall.  You know, 10 acres, 5 acres, 2 acres, 1 acre.  Then I realized that’s a long time; that’s a big walk.  A lot of it — a lot of the wall you have is incredibly natural.  It’s — you have the mountains.  You have the rivers.  You have some very powerful water areas.  You have some areas that are virtually impossible to get by.  So we didn’t need walls everywhere, but where we needed them — because it’s been so successful that we’ve added nearly 300 miles.  And that’s currently under construction.  This was our original wish: to get these areas done where it was such trouble.  And now we have it.  It’s either in construction or pre-construction — an additional 300 miles. In every region that we’ve built the wall, illegal crossings and drug smuggling have plummeted.  Absolutely plummeted.  In the Rio Grande Valley, crossings have dropped nearly 80 percent.  In Yuma, Arizona, illegal entries have been slashed by 90 percent.  Nationwide, ICE and Border Patrol have seized over 2 million pounds of fentanyl, heroin, meth, and other deadly narcotics, saving thousands and thousands of lives. We’ve arrested nearly 500,000 illegal aliens with criminal records — some with very serious criminal records of the type you don’t want to know about, like murder. We removed nearly 20,000 gang members from the United States, including 4,500 members of MS-13 — probably the worst gang of them all.  Through the landmark reforms we’ve put into place, we have ended the immigration chaos and reestablished American sovereignty.  Our most important reform was ending catch and release — not easy to do; you’re dealing with Congress; it’s very, very difficult — which is the functional equivalent of open borders, but even worse: It’s catch and release them.  It means release into our country, not into another country. This policy was exploited by vicious criminal organizations, who understood the laws better than our people understood them for years, to spread misery and suffering and drugs all across the hemisphere. Now, instead of “catch and release,” we have “detain and remove.”  It’s called “detain and remove.”  Doesn’t that sound better?  One of the biggest loopholes we closed was asylum fraud.  Under the old, broken system, if you merely requested asylum, you were released into the country.  The most ridiculous thing anyone has ever seen.  And we were taking in some people that you didn’t want to have in your country. We instituted a series of historic policy changes to shut down asylum fraud, and that’s what we did.  This includes the groundbreaking agreement with Mexico known as the “Migrant Protection Protocols,” or MPP. Under this agreement, if an illegal alien requests asylum, they have to wait in Mexico until their case is heard.  They used to wait here.  And when they were waiting, they would say “bye-bye,” and they’d disappear somewhere into our country, and essentially we’d never find them again, would never see them again. This one measure alone ended a humanitarian crisis and saved countless lives, and especially, I have to say, lives from crime. I want to thank the great President of Mexico.  He is a great gentleman, a friend of mine.  And President Obrador — he is a man who really knows what’s happening.  And he loves his country, and he also loves the United States.  But I want to thank for his friendship and his professional working relationship. We actually had 27,000 Mexican soldiers guarding our borders over the last two years.  Nobody thought that was possible.  And they made it very, very difficult, and that’s why the numbers were able to plunge, even during the construction of the wall. And, by the way, one of the big elements of the wall that make it so successful is we can have far fewer people working.  Now, they can be working on other things — other things related to crime and drug prevention and a lot of other elements they’re working on, because we saved massive numbers of people.  And included here we have the most sophisticated camera systems and most sophisticated electronic systems anywhere in the world. We implemented three historic agreements with the Northern Triangle; that’s Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador.  Under these critical asylum cooperation agreements, the burden of illegal immigration is now shared all across the region.  Now, when an illegal immigrant is arrested at our border, they can be sent to a neighboring country instead of into a U.S. community. Prior to my getting here, countries wouldn’t accept them.  They would say, “No, no, no.”  I said, “Well, you got to take them.”  First month — I’ll never forget — these gentlemen, right here, came to me.  They said, “They won’t take them back.” They came.  They may be murderers.  They may be cartel heads.  They may be some really vicious people.  The countries didn’t want them back.  And I stopped all payments to those countries.  I stopped everything going to those countries.  And after it was stopped for about a month — you remember? — after it was stopped for about a month, they called.  They said, “We’d love to have them back.”  And I never gave them as much money as they were getting, by the way, but they got some.  (Applause.) It was amazing. And you people know better than anyone: They wouldn’t take them back.  We’d have planes flying over, loaded up with people that we didn’t want here.  And they’d say, “Don’t ever even think about landing that plane.”  And they’d take them by boat, and they’d take them by bus, and they wouldn’t let them into their countries.  And all of a sudden, they say, “Welcome back.  We love having you.” So it was a great thing.  And now they do take them back.  And the relationship with those countries — the Triangle — the relationship is a much better one than it was before. In addition to our agreements with Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador, we have systematically reformed the regulatory code to return asylum to its original legal meaning and purpose — not a free ticket for entry. A recent comprehensive report by the Department of Homeland Security and Justice show how effective our reforms have been and how disastrous their removal would be.  It would be a disaster for our country.  I know they’re thinking about removing them.  I hope they don’t do that.  I hope they don’t do that.  It’ll be a absolute travesty for our country. The report conclusively proves, once and for all, that aliens released at the border remain at large in the country and do not return home.  They won’t go home.  And you rarely find them.  It’s very tough to find them. So we have aliens released in our country, many of whom are serious criminals.  And we’ve stopped that.  Don’t ever start that process again.  By contrast, under our policies, 98 percent of aliens that remain in DHS custody are removed.  Simply put, if you enter the United States illegally, you are apprehended and immediately safely removed from our country.  Without this core principle, there is no border, there is no law, there is no order. My administration also instituted vital public health measures on the border.  In response to the China virus, under Title 42 of the U.S. Code, illegal immigrants are being promptly removed to protect the health of border agents, other migrants, and local communities, and the public at large.  Removing these protections would invite a public health catastrophe of epic proportions. As you probably know, in Tijuana, various parts of Mexico, the COVID — it’s got about 24 names I can call it, from “COVID” to “China virus.”  I can call it the “plague.”  I call it the “China plague.”  A lot of different names.  But we always call it the “invisible enemy.”  But the invisible enemy has been very tough on Mexico, and we have areas along the border where we’re in great shape because right there, because of that, that we’re in great shape.  But on the other side, in Mexico, they’re suffering greatly with the virus.  It’s been incredible what we’ve achieved.  And we didn’t do the wall because of COVID; we did the wall because of security and drugs and other things.  But it turned out that, in the middle of it all, along came this horrible plague. We inherited a dangerously lawless border.  The people that work here are unbelievably brave.  I’ve seen what they have to endure, what they have to go through.  They’re tough, they’re strong, and they’re great patriots, great Americans. We fixed it and we secured it.  We empowered our wonderful ICE and Border Patrol to fulfill their oaths and sworn officers.  They became sworn officers of the law.  And they love their job.  It’s a tough job.  It’s a nasty job.  They’re not paid what they should be paid, to be honest, but we got you up.  We got you up.  But these are incredibly talented people that could probably do a lot better, in terms of economics, than they do here.  But they love what they do, and they love their country. We also put into place vital measures to protect American workers, keep out terrorists, and stop the abuse of our welfare system — where they’d come up, go on our welfare system, and live for years on American welfare without ever having a job. We also have, and we had — but we have them all the time — we have terrorists from the Middle East coming into our country through the southern border.  That was before what you see right here, because it was easier to come into our country through the southern border than it was through airports or any other means.  So they’d land in South America, and they’d work their way up, and they’d come into our country.  And these are not people from the countries that you would suspect.  These are people from some very seriously dangerous places in the Middle East.  And the numbers are far greater than anybody would understand.  Really far greater. Removing any of these measures would hamstring our workers, endanger our country, and cost taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars a year. No matter our party, we should all agree on the need to protect our workers, our families, and our citizens of all backgrounds, no matter who they are.  In particular, if our border security measures are reversed, it will trigger a tidal wave of illegal immigration — a wave like you’ve never seen before.  And I can tell you that, already, waves are starting to come up from 2,000 and 1,000 and 500 miles away.  We see what’s coming. And they’re coming because they think that it’s gravy train at the end; it’s going to be a gravy train.  Change the name from the “caravans,” which I think we came up with, to the “gravy train,” because that’s what they’re looking for — looking for the gravy. This will be an unmitigated calamity for national security, public safety, and public health.  It would destroy millions and millions of jobs and claim thousands of innocent lives.  The policies I put into place are uniformly and strongly supported by the men and women of ICE and Border Patrol.  We worked on them together, just like we did on the wall.  We worked on the policies together because nobody knows this whole world better than the incredible people right in front of me.  To terminate those policies is knowingly to put America in really serious danger and to override the great career experts that have worked so hard — those from DHS. At this very moment, smugglers and coyotes are preparing to surge the border if our policies are loosened or removed.  I mean, they’re literally waiting — big, big groups of people.  Some of them very unsavory, I might add. This is an entirely preventable tragedy.  It’s waiting to happen.  The safety of our nation must come before politics.  We have many disagreements in the country, but we should all agree: the urgent need to secure our borders, protect our homeland, and allow law enforcement to fulfill its mission without political interference. ICE and Border Patrol agents swore a sacred oath to uphold the law, and no political appointee should ever order them to violate that oath.  These are real experts.  They really get it. And I’ll tell you who else gets it: The Hispanic population of our country gets it.  Because not only did I win Texas in historic numbers, but I won border towns, which are largely Hispanic, and people were amazed to see that.  And the numbers, they say, were — the Governor of Texas called — Greg — great guy, great governor — called.  He said, “You had numbers that nobody has had since Reconstruction.  “Reconstruction” means “Civil War.”  And largely Hispanic.  They understand it better than anybody, and they want law enforcement to help them — help them live safe lives. The laws that Congress passed must be upheld.  To the men and women of ICE, Customs and Border Protection, and all across DHS, law enforcement in general: You have earned the everlasting gratitude of our nation.  You have no idea how much our nation loves you and respects you.  I don’t think you do have an idea, but it’s true.  I only hope and pray that your voice will be heard, honored, heeded, and respected long into the future. God bless you.  God bless law enforcement.  And God bless America.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Great job.  (Applause.)  \n",

County, Maryland 10:27 A.M. EST THE PRESIDENT: I think that big tech is doing a horrible thing for our country and to our country. And I believe it’s going to be a catastrophic mistake for them. They’re dividing and divisive, and they’re showing something that I’ve been predicting for a long time. I’ve been predicting it for a long time, and people didn’t act on it. But I think big tech has made a terrible mistake, and very, very bad for our country. And that’s leading others to do the same thing, and it causes a lot of problems and a lot of danger. Big mistake. They shouldn’t be doing it. But there’s always a counter move when they do that. I’ve never seen such anger as I see right now, and that’s a terrible thing. Terrible thing. And you have to always avoid violence. And we have — we have tremendous support. Q What is your role, sir? THE PRESIDENT: We have support probably like nobody has ever seen before. Always have to avoid violence. Q Mr. President, what is your role in what happened at the Capitol? What is your personal responsibility? THE PRESIDENT: So if you read my speech — and many people have done it, and I’ve seen it both in the papers and in the media, on television — it’s been analyzed, and people thought that what I said was totally appropriate. And if you look at what other people have said — politicians at a high level — about the riots during the summer, the horrible riots in Portland and Seattle, in various other — other places, that was a real problem — what they said. But they’ve analyzed my speech and words and my final paragraph, my final sentence, and everybody, to the T, thought it was totally appropriate. Okay, thank you. Thank you. END 10:29 A.M. EST  \n",

EST THE PRESIDENT:  So, we’re going to Texas.  We’re going to the southern border.  As you know, we’ve completed the wall.  They may want to expand it.  We have the expansion underway.  It’s been tremendously successful, far beyond what anyone thought.  We’re stopping, in large numbers, the drugs coming into the country for many, many years and decades.  We’re stopping a lot of illegal immigration.  Our numbers have been very good. There does seem to be a surge now because people are coming up.  Some caravans are starting to form because they think there’s going to be a lot in it for them if they’re able to get through, but we’re able to stop it.  The wall has made a tremendous difference.  I think some of you are coming with me.  But the wall has made a tremendous difference on the southern border. As far as this is concerned, we want no violence.  Never violence.  We want absolutely no violence. And on the impeachment, it’s really a continuation of the greatest witch hunt in the history of politics.  It’s ridiculous.  It’s absolutely ridiculous. This impeachment is causing tremendous anger, and you’re doing it, and it’s really a terrible thing that they’re doing.  For Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer to continue on this path, I think it’s causing tremendous danger to our country and it’s causing tremendous anger.  I want no violence.

I’m honored to welcome doctors, scientists, industry executives, and state and local leaders to our historic Operation Warp Speed Vaccine Summit. It’s been some journey for all of us. It’s been an incredible success. We’re grateful to be joined by Vice President Mike Pence, who has done an absolutely incredible job on the Coronavirus Task Force. Mike, thank you. Stand up, Mike. (Applause.) Great job. We’re here to discuss a monumental national achievement. From the instant the coronavirus invaded our shores, we raced into action to develop a safe and effective vaccine at breakneck speed. It would normally take five years, six years, seven years, or even more. In order to achieve this goal, we harnessed the full power of government, the genius of American scientists, and the might of American industry to save millions and millions of lives all over the world. We’re just days away from authorization from the FDA, and we’re pushing them hard, at which point we will immediately begin mass distribution. Before Operation Warp Speed, the typical timeframe for development and approval, as you know, could be infinity. And we were very, very happy that we were able to get things done at a level that nobody has ever seen before. The gold standard vaccine has been done in less than nine months. On behalf of the entire nation, I want to thank everyone here today who has been involved in this extraordinary American initiative. I also want to recognize members of my administration who have worked tirelessly in this effort: Alex Azar. Please, Alex. Where’s Alex? Thank you, Alex. Great job. (Applause.) Moncef Slaoui. Where are you, Moncef? Thank you very much. Great job. (Applause.) A man who’s now going to be very important, General Gus Perna. I have no doubt about it, right? (Applause.) Logistics. Jared Kushner. He’s worked so hard. Where’s Jared? Jared, wherever you may be. Thank you. Thank you, Jared. (Applause.) Dr. Deborah Birx. Deborah? Thank you very much, Deborah. (Applause.) Admiral Brett Giroir. Where is Brett? (Applause.) Great job you’ve been doing, Brett. Surgeon General Jerome Adams. (Applause.) Jerome, thank you very much. Terrific. Dr. Robert Redfield. (Applause.) Robert, thank you very much. Appreciate it. Administrator Seema Verma. Seema? Thank you. (Applause.)\\nDr. Peter Marks. Peter? Where’s Peter? Thank you. (Applause.)\\nPaul Mango, Adam Boehler, and Brad Smith — thank you very much. Great job. (Applause.) Thank you all very much. Incredible job. And many others, also. Many, many others. We’re also grateful to be joined by Governors Greg Abbott. Where’s Greg? (Applause.) Bill Lee. Bill? (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Bill. Ron DeSantis. Ron? (Applause.) Thank you, Ron. Thank you. Thank you very much. Great job, Ron. And John Bel Edwards. John Bel. Thank you. (Applause.) Thank you, John Bel. Thank you very much. As well as Senator John Barrasso, who is a fantastic doctor, also, by the way, I have to say. (Applause.) When we — when I need info on that subject, I call up John. Thank you, John, very much. Senator Steve Daines. Congratulations on a great win. Great win. (Applause.) That was easier than you thought, it turned out, right? It was a little easier than you thought. Great going. We’re proud of you. Congressman Greg Walden. Greg, thank you very much. (Applause.) Thank you very much. And Congressman Brad Wenstrup. Thank you, Brad. (Applause.) Great job. And many, many others. My administration provided a total of $14 billion to accelerate vaccine development and to manufacture all of the top candidates in advance — long in advance. As a result of this unprecedented investment, we are exceedingly proud that both Pfizer and Moderna have announced that their vaccines are approximately 95 percent effective, which is a number that nobody expected to be able to get to, far exceeding anything that really we — that anybody thought. We went out and we said, “What do you think a maximum would be?” And I think doctors — we all came up to the conclusion that something like that would be really incredible. And we have other candidates looking right now. We have some big ones that we’re going to be announcing very soon. We have some companies — great, great companies out there you all know about: Johnson & Johnson and — and others. And they’re all coming in, and they’re coming in very quickly. We expect to have some news on that very shortly. And we have worked very well with the companies, but if for any reason we have any problems, we will be instituting the Defense Production Act, and we will make sure that we don’t have any problems for very long. We’ve instituted it before. Two additional companies, AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson — as you know, the Johnson & Johnson is a one-dose, one-shot vaccine, so we’re going to see how that works. That would be very helpful if that all came out, and I think it probably will. Also, they’re showing tremendous — tremendous promise, all of them. Tremendous prob- — We’re — we’re very hopeful that the FDA will authorize the Pfizer vaccine within days. We got to get it moving. And Moderna vaccine almost immediately thereafter. Large numbers of tests and samples have been done, so hopefully that’ll go very quickly. If authorized, tens of millions of vaccine doses will be available this month. And we’ll get it distributed very quickly. We have that all set. And hundreds of millions more will quickly follow. Every American who wants the vaccine will be able to get the vaccine. And we think by spring we’re going to be in a position that nobody would have believed possible just a few months ago. (Applause.) Yeah. Amazing. Really amazing. They say it’s — they say it’s somewhat of a miracle, and I think that’s true. The plan we put forward prioritizes the elderly and patients with underlying conditions, as well as healthcare workers and first responders. The ultimate decision rests with the governors of the various states — and I hope the governors make wise decisions — who will decide where the vaccines will go in their state and who will get them first. We urge the governors to put America’s seniors first, and also, I think those who work with seniors, which obviously you’re going to have to do that. I think they have to go together. And doctors, nurses, first responders, et cetera. This will quickly and dramatically reduce deaths and hospitalizations. And within a short period of time, I think we want to get back to normal. A very standard phrase. We want to just get back to normal, get back to where we were a little more than nine months ago. We were doing incredibly. And in many respects, we’re still doing incredibly with our stock markets and everything else, which are hitting all new highs. We’ve already finalized a partnership with Walgreens and CVS, whose executives join us today. Thank you very much for being here. Thank you very much. We appreciate it very much. (Applause.) And they will deliver vaccines directly to nursing homes as soon as the states request that they do so. Later today, General Gus Perna will outline the detailed plan to rapidly distribute the vaccine to every state, territory, and tribe. States have designated over 50,000 sites that will receive the vaccine. We’ve worked very closely with the states. Actually, we’ve had very good relationships with the governors — I almost think all of the governors — at least in those conference calls that are somewhat secret, other than sometimes on occasion, Mike, the press will break in, which is fine too. (Laughter.) It’s amazing how you leave those rooms and about 10 seconds later — there wasn’t even time for a leak — they were on the call. (Laughter.) But that’s all right. So you assume that. You always assume that. But they’ll be going through pharmacies, hospitals, healthcare providers. Through our partnership with FedEx, UPS, and McKesson, we’ll ship doses from warehouses directly to the designated sites. And we’re thrilled to be joined by representatives of those, really, great American companies. Those companies have worked with us, and they’ve been incredible to work with. And I want to thank you all for being here. Please, thank you very much. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you very much. As I’ve stated all along — and I guess as you saw pretty vividly. I heard about the — I heard about what they — we’re going to show prior to my coming. You saw that very few people thought that this was possible. Of course, they’ll be saying now, “We always told you it was so.” But we have them saying a little bit different. But it has been incredible. And it will end the pandemic. It will end the pandemic. And we’re working with other nations. As you see actually by looking at your screen today, we’re working very closely with other nations also to get the vaccines out to other nations. And that’s very important. We work with the world. We’re working with the world. We have great companies, and we’re working with the world. In just a few minutes, I’ll sign an executive order to ensure that the United States government prioritizes the getting out of the vaccine to American citizens before sending it to other nations. Now, if necessary, I told you, we’ll invoke the Defense Production Act, but we don’t think it will be necessary. If it is — it’s a very powerful act, as you know, because we’ve used it very, very successfully. While we begin to swiftly deploy the vaccine, we’ll continue to expand the availability of groundbreaking therapies. Since April, advances in treatments have already helped reduce the mortality rate by 85 percent. Think of that: 85 percent. (Applause.) It’s an incredible number. I’ve delivered on my solemn promise to make the antibody treatments — they’re brilliant; they’re highly successful — available to every American, and we’re doing that free of cost — totally free of cost. So we’re making them available, and they’re available now. And if somebody gets sick, it works, where they go and they get treatment if that’s what the doctors are prescribing. And it’s been incredible, the success. And when you hear 85 percent, that’s some number. To me, that’s a number that goes along with anything else, including the vaccines, when you think about it. As well as we’ve done with the vaccines, when you hear “85 percent,” people — people find that one hard to believe. But you look at the stats, and you see what’s happening. And you look at other countries; they’re having tremendous difficulties in Europe — tremendous. Beyond — relatively beyond what we’re having. They’re having them all over the world. But this will vanquish the — the problem, this horrible scourge — as I call it, the “China virus,” because that’s where it came from. The virus has really been looked at and studied all over the world, and our scientists, our industrial and economic mobilization has been like nobody else in the world could have done. And it’s very important that we share that with others and other nations. I’ve worked and invoked the Defense Production Act over 100 times to manufacture essential supplies in the United States. Despite the grim projections from the media eight months ago, where they said this was impossible — they actually said — and you saw that a little bit, but I could give you two hours’ worth of it. But they said it will never happen; you could never do it; it was a pipe dream. But we — we did something that nobody thought was possible. And we also did it where no American who has needed a ventilator has been denied a ventilator. When we — when this first came out, we weren’t equipped for that. Nobody was equipped for that. And we’re now making ventilators. And we have all we need in this country, but we’re sending them to countries all over the world. We’re making thousands and thousands of ventilators a month. The United States has also created the largest, most advanced, and most innovative testing program in the world by far. We’ve conducted over 200 million tests. Think of that: 200 million tests — more than all of the European Union combined. It’s not even close. Just 10 months ago, none of these innovations even existed. The tremendous progress that we’ve made is a testament to what our nation is capable of. When America is faced with a challenge, we come through — and we always come through — to overcome every hardship and surmount every obstacle. And I think you’ll be seeing that over the next few months; the numbers should skyrocket downward. We are the most exceptional nation in the history of the world. Today, we’re on the verge of another American medical miracle. And that’s what people are saying. People that aren’t necessarily big fans of Donald Trump are saying, “Whether you like him or not, this is one of the greatest miracles in the history of modern-day medicine” or any other medicine — any other age of medicine. American companies were the first to produce a verifiably safe and effective vaccine. Together, we will defeat the virus, and we will soon end the pandemic, and we will save millions and millions of lives, both in our country and all over the world. And we’ve already started. Thank you again to every person here today and for the incredible achievements that you’ve done. You’re going to be very proud of this day, and you’re going to be very proud of this period of time because nobody thought this was possible. Nobody thought it was even remotely possible to do what we’ve done in a period of less than nine months — something that — just not even thinkable. And we took a lot of heat when we said this is our goal, and we, frankly, weren’t even quite using the numbers that we used. We far exceeded what we thought. If we would have said “sometime next year,” I think most people would have said, “That would be great. That would be a miracle.” But we did it long before sometime next year. So now I want to ask several leaders who have been crucial in this effort to join me on stage as I sign the executive order to ensure that American citizens have first priority to receive American vaccines. And then we’re going to be working with other countries all over the world, and I think we’ll be able to start doing that almost immediately also, because we have millions of doses coming in. So thank you very much. Thank you. It’s a great honor. (Applause.) (The executive order is signed.) So, let’s see here. I guess we have to do our Vice President, right? (Applause.) AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you, Mr. President. THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. (Applause.) Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you. (Applause.) Any questions, please? (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you all. (Applause.) Any questions, please? A question? Yes, please. Q Mr. President, it’s clearly a success, this vaccine. I’m wondering, though, what your message is to the American people, given all of the increasing cases right now, about what they should do over Christmas and the hardship that they’re all facing as this virus does get worse. THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, well, CDC puts out their guidelines, and they’re very important guidelines, but I think this: I think that the vaccine was our goal. That was number one because that was the way — that was the way it ends. Plus, you do have an immunity. You develop immunity over a period of time, and I hear we’re close to 15 percent. I’m hearing that, and that is terrific. That’s a very powerful vaccine in itself. And just tremendous progress has been made. One of the reasons we do show so many — and I say this, and I’ve been saying it for a long time — so many cases is because of the fact that we have 200 million tests. And you take — I think India is actually in second place with just a fraction of that number. So we’re many times greater than the second country, and India has 1.4 billion people where — our testing program has been incredible. And we actually are also coming out with new tests very shortly that will make the process even easier, and you won’t need doctors necessarily to do the test. So we have some incredible tests coming out in a very short period of time. Yeah, please. Q Mr. President, some of these scientific officials here in this room have encouraged Americans not to travel this holiday season, not to go to large gatherings. Across the street, you’ve been holding holiday parties with hundreds of people, many not wearing masks. Why are you modeling a different behavior to the American people than what your scientists tell? THE PRESIDENT: Well, they’re Christmas parties, and frankly, we’ve reduced the number very substantially, as you know. And I see a lot of people at the parties wearing masks. I mean, I would say that I look out at the audience at those parties, and we have a lot of people wearing masks, and I think that’s a good thing. Yeah, please. Over here. Go ahead. Q The next administration will be the one, ultimately, that implements a lot of the distribution of this vaccine and will oversee much of the future of the way Operation Warp Speed goes forward. Why not include members of the Biden transition team as part of this summit that you’re hosting today? THE PRESIDENT: Well, we’re going to have to see who the next administration is — because we won in those swing states, and there was terrible things that went on. So we’re going to have to see who the next administration is. But whichever the next administration is will really benefit by what we’ve been able to do with this incredible science, the doctors — all of the people that came up — the lab technicians. The wor- — the work that’s been done is incredible, and it will be incredible for the next administration. And hopefully the next administration will be the Trump administration, because you can’t steal hundreds of thousands of votes. You can’t have fraud and deception and all of the things that they did, and then slightly win a swing state. And you just have to look at the numbers. Look at what’s been on tape. Look at all the corruption. And we’ll see. You can’t win an election like that. So hopefully the next administration will be the Trump administration, a continuation — which has led us to the highest stock markets we’ve ever had, the best employment numbers we’ve ever had, a rebuilt military. If you look at — the tax reductions are the greatest in history; the regulation reductions, the greatest in history. It leads us to Space Force, which nobody thought was possible. All of the things we’ve done. And we were rewarded with a victory. Now, let’s see whether or not somebody has the courage — whether it’s a legislator or legislatures, or whether it’s a justice of the Supreme Court or a number of justices of the Supreme Court. Let’s see if they have the courage to do what everybody in this country knows is right. I received almost 75 million votes, the highest number of votes in the history of our country for a sitting President — 12 million more than the 63 million we received four years ago. President Obama received 3 million less in his second term, and he won easily. I received 12 million more, which, by the way, is a record. Twelve million more. And they say that when the numbers came out — and the numbers came through machines. And all of those ballots were taken away and added. All you have to do is turn on your local television set and you’ll see what happened with thousands of ballots coming out from under tables — with all of the terrible things you saw. All you have to do is take a look. And if somebody has the courage, I know who the next administration will be. And I’ll tell you what: Life will be much easier for this country because of what we’ve done right now and because of a lot of the people in this room. The job you’ve done on the vaccine, together with a lot of others, has been a modern-day miracle, and it’s really been acknowledged as such. And I want to thank you. I want to give you my love, and I want to give you my thanks because you’re very special people. And now, good luck. You distribute that, General, and really set records. Okay? Set records, just like we’ve been doing for four years. Thank you very much. Thank you, everybody. Thank you. (Applause.) END 2:28 P.M. EST  "
